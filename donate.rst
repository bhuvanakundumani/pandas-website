You can support pandas by becoming a `Tidelift subscriber <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pandas?utm_source=pypi-pandas&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme>`__.

More specifically, donations can be used to work towards major improvements of the *pandas* Project, including:

* Fixing long-standing limitations or inconsistencies in missing data (null values in integer and boolean data, and a more consistent notion of null / NA).
* Improved performance and utilization of multicore systems.
* Better user control / visibility of memory usage.
* Clearer semantics around non-NumPy data types, and permitting new pandas-only data types to be added.
* Exposing a “libpandas” C/C++ API to other Python library developers.

More information about this can be found in the "pandas 2.0" design documents: https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas2/index.html
